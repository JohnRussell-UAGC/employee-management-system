# Employee Management System: Assignment 1

## Overview

This assignment is the first step towards building your very own Employee Management System. The task for this week is to set up a new React application from scratch. The skills you will practice include creating a new React app, building your own components, setting up your development environment, and getting started with Git source control.

## Assignment Goals

1. Setting up the React development environment.
2. Creating a new React application.
3. Building a basic layout with React components.
4. Using Git for source control and managing project versions.

## Instructions

### Setting up your Development Environment

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). React requires Node.js version 10.16.0 or later.

2. Install the Create-React-App command-line utility globally on your machine. Use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

### Creating a new React Application

Create a new React app by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app employee-management-system
```

After running the command, a new folder named `employee-management-system` will be created with all the necessary files and folders to start your new React application.

### Git Branching and Committing Changes

Before starting to code, it's a good practice to create a new Git branch for your assignment. This allows you to separate your changes for each assignment and makes code reviews and grading easier.

To create a new branch, navigate to your project directory in your terminal and use the following commands:

```bash
git checkout -b assignment-1
```

This command creates a new branch named `assignment-1` and switches to it.

As you change your project, remember to commit your work frequently. This helps to track your progress and revert changes if something goes wrong.

To add and commit changes, use the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Building a Basic Layout

Build a basic layout for your application. At this stage, you are not required to implement any functionality. Your goal is to create a layout with dummy data. The layout can be as simple as a header, main section, and a footer.

Here's a basic example:

1. Header - a simple header with the name of your application.
2. Main Section - a table or a list to display employee details (use dummy data for now).
3. Footer - a simple footer with some text.

Feel free to explore and get creative with your components!

## Submission

When you have completed the assignment, push your code to your branch on the repository.

```bash
git push origin assignment-1
```

Once you have pushed your changes, create a pull request for your branch.

Good luck and happy coding!
