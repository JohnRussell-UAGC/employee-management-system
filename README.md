# Employee Management System: Assignment 2

## Overview

Welcome to Assignment 2! In this assignment, you will build upon the foundation you've created in Assignment 1, and will continue developing your Employee Management System. The focus of this week's task is adding interactivity to your React app. You will learn how to handle user input, manage state in a component, and respond to user actions.

## Assignment Goals

1. Learn how to handle user input in React.
2. Understand and manage the state of a component.
3. Respond to user actions (like button clicks).
4. Compare and contrast your progress on GitHub.

## Instructions

### Setting Up Your New Branch

Before you start working on this assignment, create a new Git branch based off `master` or `assignment-1`. This helps to keep your code organized as you progress through the assignments. Use the following commands to create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b assignment-2
```

### Handling User Input

Create a form that allows users to add new employees to your application. At this stage, you can use dummy data to simulate the creation of new employees.

### Managing State

The form you create should have its own state that manages the input values. When the form is submitted, it should clear the inputs.

### Responding to User Actions

When a user submits the form, show a notification or an alert that a new employee has been added. This will not yet add an actual employee, but should demonstrate that the form is working as expected.

### Comparing Branches on GitHub

Before you start your assignment, take some time to compare the changes between this assignment and Assignment-1 using the provided link. 

[Compare Assignment 1 and Assignment 2](https://github.com/JohnRussell-UAGC/employee-management-system/commit/b48da73b4b0e06de56986465af44e2fb9d1e2f08?diff=split)

This comparison will give you an understanding of the new code added in Assignment 2 as compared to Assignment 1. It can help you grasp the progression of the project and learn from the changes made.

## Submission

When you have completed the assignment, push your code to your branch on the repository.

```bash
git push origin assignment-2
```

Once you have pushed your changes, create a pull request for your branch.

Enjoy the process and happy coding!
