# Interactive Employee Management System

Welcome to the Interactive Employee Management System repository! This project is designed to help students learn and practice their coding skills by gradually building an employee management system over the course of several weeks. Each week, students will add new features and functionality to the codebase, gradually transforming it into a fully-featured system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:** The recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this project is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). It offers a wide range of features and extensions that can significantly improve your coding experience. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Additionally, explore its extensions marketplace to find tools that can enhance your development workflow. Some recommended extensions include ESLint, Prettier, and GitLens.

2. **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JohnRussell-UAGC/employee-management-system.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** After cloning, navigate into the directory of the project and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. This is an essential step, as the project requires specific packages to run correctly.

4. **Set up the development environment:** Ensure that you have the necessary development tools and dependencies installed on your machine. You may need a specific version of a programming language or framework, so make sure to check the project's requirements and install the necessary software accordingly.

5. **Week-by-Week Progression:** This repository is organized into different branches, each representing a specific week of the project. Start with the initial branch (`week-1`) and progress through each subsequent week, following the instructions and guidelines provided in each branch's README file.

## Repository Structure
You can navigate the repository by using the dropdown towards the top right of this page that currently says "Master"

The repository has the following structure:

- `assignment-1`: This branch contains the initial setup and basic functionality of the employee management system. It serves as the starting point for the project.

- `assignment-2`: This branch builds upon the codebase from the previous week and adds a basic input form to the project.

- `assignment-3`: This branch continues the project's progression, introducing saving items into a browser's local storage.

- `assignment-4`: This branch represents the final week of the project. There is a display list of added employees, and clicking the name goes to a details page.

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and serves as a guide to help you navigate through the repository.

## Contributing

If you're a student participating in this project, we encourage you to engage in the learning process actively. Here are a few tips to make the most out of this experience:

- **Read the weekly instructions:** Each branch's README file will contain instructions specific to that week's tasks. You can compare the changes between branches along the way, and see the new code being added to the project.
  
- **Experiment and explore:** Don't limit yourself to following instructions. Feel free to experiment and explore additional functionality or improvements beyond what is explicitly mentioned. This will help you solidify your understanding and enhance your skills. Proper source control management will allow you to rollback the code to any commit, so commit when things are working and then experiment. If it doesn't work, roll back any pending changes since the last commit and try again.

- **Collaborate and seek help:** If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to contact your fellow students or the instructor. Collaboration and seeking help are essential parts of the learning process.

- **Document your progress:** Throughout the project, consider documenting your progress, challenges, and solutions in a personal development log. This will serve as a valuable resource for reflection and review.

- **Celebrate milestones:** As you complete each week's tasks, take a moment to celebrate your achievements. Reflect on the progress you've made and the knowledge you've gained. This will help you stay motivated and inspired throughout the project.

## Conclusion

We hope this interactive project provides an engaging and educational experience for all participating students. Remember, the key to success is consistency, perseverance, and an eagerness to learn. Enjoy the journey, and happy coding!

Good luck, and have fun!
